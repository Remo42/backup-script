windows server installing
installing vs code
research
make script (backup)
test
fail
research more
make new script (backup)
test, it works
now it has gui
now it can restore
now you can browse important folders
now it can be run quietly with -cli flag
now it is in github



maybe now it can be run with task scheduler
maybe it can be a group policy

future:
make beautiful readme file in github: (LEARN MARKDOWN)
gifs, pictures of all screens (main screen and restore window)
how to use
cli flag info
